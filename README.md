## Show Recommendation System
This library provides show recommendations based on the user-specified genre. 

### I. Project Plan
* Phase 1: Connect to Youtube API to retrieve show information (title and genre) for a pre-defined set of genres. The results are saved into a csv file. 
* Phase 2: Build a recommendation system that takes a csv file as input. Define a function to clean the show information remove any unwanted characters. Define a function to recommend top 10 shows using TF-IDF and cosine similarity based on a user-input show genre.
    * Use type hints
    * Doc strings
    * Try organizing into a class
* Phase 3: Write tests and documentation
